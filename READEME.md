# **Vue Web Interface for Raspberry Pi Project**

This repository contains the frontend web interface built with Vue.js for the Raspberry Pi project, aimed at replacing the Control By Web (CBW) system with a custom circuit board powered by an embedded Raspberry Pi.

_[Control By Web](https://controlbyweb.com/)_

## **Background**

- The CBW system provides remote relay control, real-time sensor readings, and a web interface for monitoring and managing hardware.
- This project aims to develop a modern, responsive web interface using **Vue.js** to replace the CBWâ€™s web functionalities.
- In addition to matching CBW's web capabilities, this frontend is designed for improved user experience, better data visualization, and enhanced integration with backend services.

## **Project Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Display live sensor data collected by the Raspberry Pi.
- **Relay Control**: Toggle relays directly from the web interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends and logs using interactive charts powered by **ECharts**.
- **Secure Access**: User authentication and role-based access control.

## **Project Installation**

1. Clone the repository:  
   **`git clone https://github.com/ValorenceCLE/Frontend.git`**

2. Navigate to the project directory:

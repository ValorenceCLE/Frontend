<!-- This is where real time data will be shown in a simple dashboard -->
<!-- 
This section of the RealTime.vue component is intended to display real-time data.
You can use Vue.js features such as data binding and computed properties to dynamically
update the dashboard as new data comes in. Consider using libraries like Vuex for state
management or external APIs to fetch real-time data.
